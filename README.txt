1. utilized the askBCS Learning Assistant twice (three times, but once was unproductive or helpful)
	a. received help with finding the Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year. They helped me define the starting opening price that allowed me to roll through for each ticker
	b. needed help with refining my conditional.  Set up the conditional in the correct place within the script.
	c. worked on feature to move from worksheet to worksheet.  We worked on two methods to move from one sheet to the next.  Ended up using ws.activate because it did not require putting ws. in from of every range/cell.
	d. max & min identification.  I had started with creating the if/then statements, but received help with understanding how to identify the values.

2. used a lot of the classwork to set up the code.
